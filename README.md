This new project is the opportunity to create a clean project where I want to test TDD Development 
and apply the principles of a clean architecture. I am open at any PRs that would help me improve my code quality or
new features that could be interesting to have in the project. 

## SRS Explanation

**Guru**: You know an item fairly well. Any available, associated items will unlock and appear in your Lessons queue.

**Master**: You should be able to recall these items without using the mnemonics, usually.

**Enlightened**: You should be able to recall these items without the mnemonic, fairly quickly. The answer should appear without much effort.

**Burned**: This item is “fluent” in your brain. The answer comes with little-to-no effort. You will remember this item for a long, long time. Even if you don’t use it and “forget” it sometime in the future, it should come back to you quickly after recalling it. Items that are “burned” no longer show up in reviews. You can unburn an item on an item’s individual page, which returns the item to Apprentice.
